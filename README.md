## Henrik Torp ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate and budding developer with a background in physics from the University of Oslo. My studies provided me with a strong foundation in Python programming, particularly for numerical applications, and helped me develop a solid understanding of mathematical operations that are highly useful in programming.

Currently, I am learning C# for backend development and exploring general programming architecture principles. I am also applying my previous skills to machine learning, where I built a neural network entirely from scratch using only NumPy to implement the mathematical operations, without relying on external machine learning libraries.

I am excited to continue growing as a developer and look forward to tackling more advanced challenges in the future!
